# Snap_ML_For_Creditcard_detection
In this project, we use two classification models to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. These models are: Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. We use a real dataset of credit card transactions to train each of these models and then use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.
